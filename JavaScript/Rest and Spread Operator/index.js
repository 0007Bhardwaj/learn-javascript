//  -------------------------------------------- The Spread Operator --------------------------------------------
// The spread operator, denoted by three consecutive dots (...), is primarily used for expanding iterables like arrays into individual elements.
//  This operator allows us to efficiently merge, copy, or pass array elements to functions without explicitly iterating through them.
