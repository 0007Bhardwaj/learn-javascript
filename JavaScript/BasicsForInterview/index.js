// 1. "use strict";
// JavaScript's strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode". 
// Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal code.

// Strict mode makes several changes to regular JavaScript semantics:
// a. Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
// b. Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
